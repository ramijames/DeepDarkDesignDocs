# Deep Dark Design Docs

## What is Deep Dark?
Deep dark is an homage to BBS-style dungeon crawlers from the 80s. There is a unique experience that simply hasn't been replicated in modern games. It is one of dialing into someone's personal network, buying what you needed from the shopkeep, playing a few smart actions in a dungeon, and connecting with other lurkers on similar journeys. 

It was quiet, dangerous, and secret. 

That's what Deep Dark is trying to reproduce in some online form.

## What are these documents trying to achieve?
For there to be some longterm plan, there needs to be some repository of ideas which can be forged into something more concrete and cohesive. That's what these documents are: a set of ideas that can be improved and expanded upon as needed.

## How are these documents organized?
There are a set of sub-directories, each with their own Markdown files. They are organized by:

- [Character traits and classes](https://github.com/ramijames/DeepDarkDesignDocs/Background/00_introduction.md)
- Game design
- Background story and world-building materials

## External contribution
This is really intended to be a one-man show, but external contributions are always welcome. The preferred method is to open an issue so that ideas can be discussed publicly. [You can do that here](https://github.com/ramijames/DeepDarkDesignDocs/issues).
