# Game Loop

# Intent

I intent to keep the game fairly true to the style and feel that aims to scratch that 80s BBS dungeon crawler feel. I do want to add some more modern layers of play on top of that base.

## The 80s BBS Dungeon Crawler experience

When I was a kid we had a 8084 and a c64. I'd use them to log into BBSs. This was before there was an internet that everyone could use together. These BBSs tended to be very local, and run by the nerds who were lucky enough to have enough cash to buy systems people could use externally. This typically meant that they would have between one and a few landlines connected to a constellation of modems. You'd dial a number which would connect your computer directly to their computer, they exchange some information, and then you could do a limited set of actions on their machines. 

Usually this meant:

- Play games
- Send intra-BBS messages
- Sometimes send email externally
- WareZ

As a precocious 8 year old, all I was really interested in were the games.

My favorite was a dungeon crawler that you'd log into every day. You would get a few actions that you were allowed to run before you were booted from the game until the next day. 

I'm sure that it was designed that way because physical resources were limited, and they wanted people to connect, do some stuff, disconnect, and allow the next person to play. The unintended side-effect was that it was immensely addictive. You had limited opportunity to do stuff and that meant that if you wanted to progress you had to be smart about how you went about it.

I'd like to reproduce that addictive quality in the game loop for Deep Dark. The scale of the game shouldn't be just daily, it should span the course of months.
