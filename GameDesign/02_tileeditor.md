# Tile Editor

A big part of what I'm trying to achieve is to build a community of players who are engaged not just with playing the game through dungeon runs and character development, but also who understand that there is a meta-game through the creation of unique dungeons that they themselves forge.

## Dungeonforge

What I'm calling the "Dungeonforge" will be a way for users to create their own dungeons, acting as a DM for a small-scale story that is embedded in the run.

The core flow would be in the vein of:

┌─────────────┐      ┌───────────────┐      
│             │      │               │      
│             │      │               │      
│    STORY    ├─────►│    DUNGEON    ├─────►
│             │      │               │      
│             │      │               │      
└─────────────┘      └───────────────┘      

This means that we should probably have:

- A way to write and display text cut-scenes
- A way to skip cut-scenes
- A dungeon editor
- A higher-level editor for re-arranging dungeons
- A publish screen
- Perhaps some stats screen showing playthroughs, percentages won/lost, etc.
- A way to show dungeon rankings so that there can be some competitive aspect within the community
