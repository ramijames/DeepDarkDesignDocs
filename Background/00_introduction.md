# A Deep Dark Story

A town sits at the edge of the world. It is a gathering point for those who seek adventure, riches, or glory. It also draw those who are lost, and have nowhere else that they may go.

This town is small, numbering no more than {{ users.count }} desperate souls. They have been drawn to the gaping maw of a tear between our world, and the next. A place where mortals can slip, perhaps unnoticed, into the other realms close to ours. These are filled with danger, but also with what men seek most: to know that their names will be remembered.

The dungeons themselves are as diverse as the adventurers who dare to dream them. For this is the most strange of truths: the dungeons into which our adventurers descend are none other than the dreams of their own. Each dreams the nightmare the others must triumph over!

Equipped with swords, spells, and unwavering determination, brave adventurers descend into the depths of these shadow realms, perhaps to conquer, or perhaps to never be seen again.
