# A Deep Dark Story

A small town sits at the edge of the world. It is a jumble of quickly built huts and houses, mismatched and worn. A road runs through it, with all the world on one side, and a swirling hole of nothing on the other.

This town acts as the gathering point for those who come to dream, and to experience the dreams of others.

They come for The Scratch, a tear between worlds. It is a place where mortals can slip into the worlds that they themselves imagined. These worlds are filled with every wonder, and every danger. These worlds are filled with what men seek most: to know that their names will be remembered.

The Dream Dungeons themselves are as diverse as the adventurers who dare to dream them. For this is the most strange of truths: the dungeons into which our adventurers descend are none other than the dreams of their own. Each dreams the nightmare the others must triumph over!

Equipped with swords, spells, and unwavering determination, brave adventurers descend into the depths of these shadow realms, perhaps to conquer, or perhaps to never be seen again.
